# How summer heat spikes influence sea urchin behavior and seen through righting time
Summer tidal conditions seen in the Gulf of Maine off the coast of Salem, Massachussetts were recreated in lab. Ambient tidal conditions were compared to heat spike conditions that have been occurring more frequently in the past view years. Green sea urchins were placed in each treatment condition to analyze behavorial differences. We measured sea urchin righting time, the amount of time it take for the organism to return to an upright postion after being inverted. Each experiment was run for three consecutive days and repeated for three weeks, each week with a different group of urchins. The ambient and heat treatment each housed four urchins at a time, therefore a total of 24 urchins were tested. Data was collected the summer of 2018 at the University of Salem marine lab, and the project was funded by University of Massachussetts, Boston and NSF.
