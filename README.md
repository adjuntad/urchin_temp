# How summer heat spikes influence sea urchin behavior as seen through righting time
The Gulf of Maine is the fastest warming body of water globally. How will this rapid warming affect its communties? 

Throughout summer months, when high air temperatures occur at low tide, tidal communities experience increased water temperatures. The summer of 2018 experienced the highest water temperature to date, 23.3˚C. When these increased temperature events occur for four days or more, they are known as heat waves, if they occurr for under four days they are referred to as heat spikes. The frequnecy of both heat waves and heat spikes is increasing, with heat spikes ocurring at a much faster rate. 

This research looks specifically at how heat spikes affect behavior of the green sea urchin, known to inhabit intertidal rock walls in the Gulf of Maine. Tidal conditions were replicated in lab, where we would measure the time it took for sea urchins to right themselves, returning to an upright position after being inverted, at different points in a tidal cycle. Sea urchins were placed in two different treatments, a heat spike treatment with a temperature range of 13-22˚C and a ambient treatment with a range of 13-17˚C. The heat spike treatment reached a high temperature that was at once rare to the environment, but has now become more common, while the ambient treatment mimics the normal temperature range of the environment. 

We were able to obtain sea urchins from Halfway Rock in the Salem Sound, Salem, Massachussetts at about a 10-20 meter depth. The urchins were acclimmated for a week in the ambient conditions and were only fed on the first day of acclimation. The experiment consisted of urchins being placed in their respective treatments where they were flipped five times within an 8-hour tidal cycle.The experiment was run for three consecutive days and repeated for three weeks, each week with a different group of urchins. Both ambient and heat spike treatment housed four urchins at a time, therefore a total fo 24 urchins were tested. 

Data was collected for each flip executed in the study. The variables recorded for each flip included: urchin ID, day, treatment, time point (point of the tidal cycle), water temperature, week, and righting time. 
  - the data, urchin_data_r.xlsx, can be found in the data file
  
Data analysis looked specifically at the influence of temperature, day, and treatment on righting time. 
  - the analysis script, urchin_analysis, can be found in the scripts folder. 

All the data was collected the summer of 2018 at the University of Salem marine lab, and the project was funded by the University of Massachussetts, Boston and NSF. Special thanks to Breck Mccollum and the Byrnes lab at UMass, Boston with the help to complete this research.
